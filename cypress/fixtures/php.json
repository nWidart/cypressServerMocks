PHP can be added to straight HTML or it can be used with a variety of templating engines and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by an interpreter, which is either implemented as a native module on the web-server or as a common gateway interface (CGI).\n\n\u003e [wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)\n\n![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/01c12653951b2fe592c1f93a13b4e289ada0e3a1/php/logo.png)\n\n# How to use this image\n\n### Create a `Dockerfile` in your PHP project\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM php:7.2-cli\nCOPY . /usr/src/myapp\nWORKDIR /usr/src/myapp\nCMD [ \"php\", \"./your-script.php\" ]\n```\n\nThen, run the commands to build and run the Docker image:\n\n```console\n$ docker build -t my-php-app .\n$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-php-app\n```\n\n### Run a single PHP script\n\nFor many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a complete `Dockerfile`. In such cases, you can run a PHP script by using the PHP Docker image directly:\n\n```console\n$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v \"$PWD\":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp php:7.2-cli php your-script.php\n```\n\n## How to install more PHP extensions\n\nMany extensions are already compiled into the image, so it's worth checking the output of `php -m` or `php -i` before going through the effort of compiling more.\n\nWe provide the helper scripts `docker-php-ext-configure`, `docker-php-ext-install`, and `docker-php-ext-enable` to more easily install PHP extensions.\n\nIn order to keep the images smaller, PHP's source is kept in a compressed tar file. To facilitate linking of PHP's source with any extension, we also provide the helper script `docker-php-source` to easily extract the tar or delete the extracted source. Note: if you do use `docker-php-source` to extract the source, be sure to delete it in the same layer of the docker image.\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM php:7.2-cli\nRUN docker-php-source extract \\\n\t# do important things \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 docker-php-source delete\n```\n\n### PHP Core Extensions\n\nFor example, if you want to have a PHP-FPM image with `iconv` and `gd` extensions, you can inherit the base image that you like, and write your own `Dockerfile` like this:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM php:7.2-fpm\nRUN apt-get update \u0026\u0026 apt-get install -y \\\n\t\tlibfreetype6-dev \\\n\t\tlibjpeg62-turbo-dev \\\n\t\tlibpng-dev \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 docker-php-ext-install -j$(nproc) iconv \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 docker-php-ext-configure gd --with-freetype-dir=/usr/include/ --with-jpeg-dir=/usr/include/ \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 docker-php-ext-install -j$(nproc) gd\n```\n\nRemember, you must install dependencies for your extensions manually. If an extension needs custom `configure` arguments, you can use the `docker-php-ext-configure` script like this example. There is no need to run `docker-php-source` manually in this case, since that is handled by the `configure` and `install` scripts.\n\nSee [\"Dockerizing Compiled Software\"](https://tianon.xyz/post/2017/12/26/dockerize-compiled-software.html) for a description of the technique Tianon uses for determining the necessary build-time dependencies for any bit of software (which applies directly to compiling PHP extensions).\n\n### PECL extensions\n\nSome extensions are not provided with the PHP source, but are instead available through [PECL](https://pecl.php.net/). To install a PECL extension, use `pecl install` to download and compile it, then use `docker-php-ext-enable` to enable it:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM php:7.2-cli\nRUN pecl install redis-4.0.1 \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 pecl install xdebug-2.6.0 \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 docker-php-ext-enable redis xdebug\n```\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM php:5.6-cli\nRUN apt-get update \u0026\u0026 apt-get install -y libmemcached-dev zlib1g-dev \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 pecl install memcached-2.2.0 \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 docker-php-ext-enable memcached\n```\n\nIt is *strongly* recommended that users use an explicit version number in their `pecl install` invocations to ensure proper PHP version compatibility (PECL does not check the PHP version compatiblity when choosing a version of the extension to install, but does when trying to install it).\n\nFor example, `memcached-2.2.0` has no PHP version constraints (https://pecl.php.net/package/memcached/2.2.0), but `memcached-3.0.4` requires PHP 7.0.0 or newer (https://pecl.php.net/package/memcached/3.0.4). When doing `pecl install memcached` (no specific version) on PHP 5.6, PECL will try to install the latest release and fail.\n\nBeyond the compatibility issue, it's also a good practice to ensure you know when your dependencies receive updates and can control those updates directly.\n\nUnlike PHP core extensions, PECL extensions should be installed in series to fail properly if something went wrong. Otherwise errors are just skipped by PECL. For example, `pecl install memcached-2.2.0 \u0026\u0026 pecl install redis-2.2.8` instead of `pecl install memcached-2.2.0 redis-2.2.8`. However, `docker-php-ext-enable memcached redis` is fine to be all in one command.\n\n### Other extensions\n\nSome extensions are not provided via either Core or PECL; these can be installed too, although the process is less automated:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM php:5.6-cli\nRUN curl -fsSL 'https://xcache.lighttpd.net/pub/Releases/3.2.0/xcache-3.2.0.tar.gz' -o xcache.tar.gz \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 mkdir -p xcache \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 tar -xf xcache.tar.gz -C xcache --strip-components=1 \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 rm xcache.tar.gz \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 ( \\\n\t\tcd xcache \\\n\t\t\u0026\u0026 phpize \\\n\t\t\u0026\u0026 ./configure --enable-xcache \\\n\t\t\u0026\u0026 make -j \"$(nproc)\" \\\n\t\t\u0026\u0026 make install \\\n\t) \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 rm -r xcache \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 docker-php-ext-enable xcache\n```\n\nThe `docker-php-ext-*` scripts *can* accept an arbitrary path, but it must be absolute (to disambiguate from built-in extension names), so the above example could also be written as the following:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM php:5.6-cli\nRUN curl -fsSL 'https://xcache.lighttpd.net/pub/Releases/3.2.0/xcache-3.2.0.tar.gz' -o xcache.tar.gz \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 mkdir -p /tmp/xcache \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 tar -xf xcache.tar.gz -C /tmp/xcache --strip-components=1 \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 rm xcache.tar.gz \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 docker-php-ext-configure /tmp/xcache --enable-xcache \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 docker-php-ext-install /tmp/xcache \\\n\t\u0026\u0026 rm -r /tmp/xcache\n```\n\n## Running as an arbitrary user\n\nFor running the Apache variants as an arbitrary user, there are several choices:\n\n-\tIf your kernel [is version 4.11 or newer](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/8460#issuecomment-312459310), you can add `--sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=0` and then `--user` should work as it does for FPM.\n-\tIf you adjust the Apache configuration to use an \"unprivileged\" port (greater than 1024 by default), then `--user` should work as it does for FPM regardless of kernel version.\n-\tOtherwise, setting `APACHE_RUN_USER` and/or `APACHE_RUN_GROUP` should have the desired effect (for example, `-e APACHE_RUN_USER=daemon` or `-e APACHE_RUN_USER=#1000` -- see [the Apache `User` directive documentation for details on the expected syntax](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_unixd.html#user)).\n\nFor running the FPM variants as an arbitrary user, the `--user` flag to `docker run` should be used (which can accept both a username/group in the container's `/etc/passwd` file like `--user daemon` or a specific UID/GID like `--user 1000:1000`).\n\n## \"`E: Package 'php-XXX' has no installation candidate`\"\n\nAs of [docker-library/php#542](https://github.com/docker-library/php/pull/542), this image blocks the installation of Debian's PHP packages. There is some additional discussion of this change in [docker-library/php#551 (comment)](https://github.com/docker-library/php/issues/551#issuecomment-354849074), but the gist is that installing Debian's PHP packages in this image leads to two conflicting installations of PHP in a single image, which is almost certainly not the intended outcome.\n\nFor those broken by this change and looking for a workaround to apply in the meantime while a proper fix is developed, adding the following simple line to your `Dockerfile` should remove the block (**with the strong caveat that this will allow the installation of a second installation of PHP, which is definitely not what you're looking for unless you *really* know what you're doing**):\n\n```dockerfile\nRUN rm /etc/apt/preferences.d/no-debian-php\n```\n\nThe *proper* solution to this error is to either use `FROM debian:XXX` and install Debian's PHP packages directly, or to use `docker-php-ext-install`, `pecl`, and/or `phpize` to install the necessary additional extensions and utilities.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThis image ships with the default [`php.ini-development`](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/php.ini-development) and [`php.ini-production`](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/php.ini-production) configuration files.\n\nIt is *strongly* recommended to use the production config for images used in production environments!\n\nThe default config can be customized by copying configuration files into the `$PHP_INI_DIR/conf.d/` directory.\n\n### Example\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM php:7.2-fpm-alpine\n\n# Use the default production configuration\nRUN mv \"$PHP_INI_DIR/php.ini-production\" \"$PHP_INI_DIR/php.ini\"\n\n# Override with custom opcache settings\nCOPY config/opcache.ini $PHP_INI_DIR/conf.d/\n```\n\n# Image Variants\n\nThe `php` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.\n\nSome of these tags may have names like buster or stretch in them. These are the suite code names for releases of [Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases) and indicate which release the image is based on. If your image needs to install any additional packages beyond what comes with the image, you'll likely want to specify one of these explicitly to minimize breakage when there are new releases of Debian.\n\n## `php:\u003cversion\u003e-cli`\n\nThis variant contains the [PHP CLI](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.php) tool with default mods. If you need a web server, this is probably not the image you are looking for. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as a base from which to build other images.\n\nIt also is the only variant which contains the (not recommended) `php-cgi` binary, which is likely necessary for some things like [PPM](https://github.com/php-pm/php-pm).\n\nNote that *all* variants of `php` contain the PHP CLI (`/usr/local/bin/php`).\n\n## `php:\u003cversion\u003e-apache`\n\nThis image contains Debian's Apache httpd in conjunction with PHP (as `mod_php`) and uses `mpm_prefork` by default.\n\n### Apache with a `Dockerfile`\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM php:7.2-apache\nCOPY src/ /var/www/html/\n```\n\nWhere `src/` is the directory containing all your PHP code. Then, run the commands to build and run the Docker image:\n\n```console\n$ docker build -t my-php-app .\n$ docker run -d --name my-running-app my-php-app\n```\n\nWe recommend that you add a `php.ini` configuration file; see the \"Configuration\" section for details.\n\n### Apache without a `Dockerfile`\n\n```console\n$ docker run -d -p 80:80 --name my-apache-php-app -v \"$PWD\":/var/www/html php:7.2-apache\n```\n\n### Changing `DocumentRoot` (or other Apache configuration)\n\nSome applications may wish to change the default `DocumentRoot` in Apache (away from `/var/www/html`). The following demonstrates one way to do so using an environment variable (which can then be modified at container runtime as well):\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM php:7.1-apache\n\nENV APACHE_DOCUMENT_ROOT /path/to/new/root\n\nRUN sed -ri -e 's!/var/www/html!${APACHE_DOCUMENT_ROOT}!g' /etc/apache2/sites-available/*.conf\nRUN sed -ri -e 's!/var/www/!${APACHE_DOCUMENT_ROOT}!g' /etc/apache2/apache2.conf /etc/apache2/conf-available/*.conf\n```\n\nA similar technique could be employed for other Apache configuration options.\n\n## `php:\u003cversion\u003e-fpm`\n\nThis variant contains PHP-FPM, which is a FastCGI implementation for PHP. See [the PHP-FPM website](https://php-fpm.org/) for more information about PHP-FPM.\n\nIn order to use this image variant, some kind of reverse proxy (such as NGINX, Apache, or other tool which speaks the FastCGI protocol) will be required.\n\nSome potentially helpful resources:\n\n-\t[PHP-FPM.org](https://php-fpm.org/)\n-\t[simplified example by @md5](https://gist.github.com/md5/d9206eacb5a0ff5d6be0)\n-\t[very detailed article by Pascal Landau](https://www.pascallandau.com/blog/php-php-fpm-and-nginx-on-docker-in-windows-10/)\n-\t[Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/q/29905953/433558)\n-\t[Apache httpd Wiki example](https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/PHPFPMWordpress)\n\n## `php:\u003cversion\u003e-alpine`\n\nThis image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org), available in [the `alpine` official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.\n\nThis variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does use [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org) instead of [glibc and friends](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html), so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. See [this Hacker News comment thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10782897) for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.\n\nTo minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools (such as `git` or `bash`) to be included in Alpine-based images. Using this image as a base, add the things you need in your own Dockerfile (see the [`alpine` image description](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) for examples of how to install packages if you are unfamiliar).\n\n# License\n\nView [license information](http://php.net/license/) for the software contained in this image.\n\nAs with all Docker images, these likely also contain other software which may be under other licenses (such as Bash, etc from the base distribution, along with any direct or indirect dependencies of the primary software being contained).\n\nSome additional license information which was able to be auto-detected might be found in [the `repo-info` repository's `php/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/tree/master/repos/php).\n\nAs for any pre-built image usage, it is the image user's responsibility to ensure that any use of this image complies with any relevant licenses for all software contained within.",
